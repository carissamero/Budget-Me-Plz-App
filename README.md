# Budget-Me-Plz-App

A web application that allows you to keep track of monthly expenses all in one place. This is a group project for the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp requiring our group to design and build our first full-stack web application using the MVC paradigm, creating our own server-side API, adding user authentication, and connecting to a database.

## Requirements

We were given the following requirements. Projects must:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

- Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Process

**What was your motivation?**
Our motivation was to build a web app using the concept from a monthly budgeting spreadsheet that Hayley created and uses every month to keep track of her income, bills, and what's leftover.

**Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to serve as a practical and useful tool for ourselves and other users.

**What problem does it solve?**
This allows users to solve the problem of not being able to see a clear view of their finances every month and removing day to day guesswork.

**What did you learn?**
We learned a lot about routing, databases and tying it all into the front end.

**What challenges did you encounter?**
We encountered challenges with sending data back and forth from the front end.
